Initalize an instance of SimpleSendMail

IMPORTANT: You must have an enterprise application created in Entra ID, which
has the SendMail Graph API permission:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-sendmail?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http#permissions

Required Parameters:
- tenant_id: Azure Tenant ID
- client_id & client_secret: OAuth Client ID & Secret
- source_mail_name: Source Email Name of the sending account
- source_mail_address: Source Email Address of the sending account

Optional Parameters:
- verbose: Setting verbose to true will initalize the class to use a logger
    set to send debug to console, using the following basic debug configuration:
    
    logging.basicConfig(
        level=logging.DEBUG,
        format="%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(lineno)s - %(funcName)20s - %(message)s",
        stream=sys.stdout,
    )
    
    Otherwise, the class just creates a new logger object based on it's __name__, 
    which inherits the logging configuration from the Python root logger:
    
    self._logger: logging.Logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

"""
Basic Usage: Single Recipient, Text Body

Required Parameters:
- subject: Specify email subject line
- recipient_emails: Specify a single recipient email address as a string
- body_content: body of the mail as a string
- body_type: String value of either "text" or "html". This example uses the
    built-in class BodyType, and references BodyType.Text to specify "text".
- importance: String value of either low, normal, or high. This example uses the
    built-in class EmailImportance, and references EmailImportance.Normal to
    specify "normal".

    body_type=BodyType.Text,  # Use the provided BodyType.Text enum to specify the body type as Text
    importance=EmailImportance.Normal,  # Use the provided EmailImportance enum to specify the importance as Normal
)

######## ADVANCED USAGE ########

"""
Advanced Usage: Multiple Recipients, CC'ed addresses, BCC'ed address, HTML email body

Note #1: You do not have to load the HTML template from the file system. Any str variable
    containing HTML can be used. This allows you to use templating engines such as 
    Jinja2 to render HTML content dynamically, and then provide it to the send_mail function.

Note #2: The recipient_emails parameter accepts either list of strings (emails), 
    or a single email string. However, the cc_recipient_emails and bcc_recipient_emails
    parameters only accept a list of strings (emails). So, even if you only want to
    CC or BCC a single email, please present it as a list containing that single email
    string.

Required Parameters:
- subject: Specify email subject line
- recipient_emails: Specify a multiple recipient email addresses as a 
    list of strings
- cc_recipient_emails: A list of email addresses as strings with which to CC
    on the email
- bcc_recipient_emails: A list of email addresses as string with which to BCC 
    on the email
- body_content: body of the mail as a string - in this case, the string 
    contents of the loaded HTML file
- body_type: String value of either "text" or "html". This example uses the
    built-in class BodyType, and references BodyType.HTML to specify "html".
- importance: String value of either low, normal, or high. This example uses 
    the built-in class EmailImportance, and references EmailImportance.High to
    specify "high".

"""
Advanced Usage: Sending one or more attachments

You can also use the built-in SimpleFileAttachment to attach one or more 
local filesystem file(s), as seen below.

The SimpleFileAttachment class supports the following parameters:
Required:
- filepath: path to file to attach

Optional:
- filename (str): optional name for file, if you want it to have a different 
    name than the file currently does. By default, the class pulls the name of 
    the file from the provided path
- content_type (str): Explicitly set the content type for the attachment 
    (such as text/plain). If not specified mimetype.guess_type is used to 
    try to guess the content_type of the file. If none can be resolved,
    a TypeError is raised.

Sending Single Attachment:
    After creating a SimpleFileAttachment, you can simply add it to the attachments
    parameter in the call to send_mail, as seen in example #2. 

Sending Multiple Attachments:
    If you're wanting to send multiple attachments, create an instance of 
    SimpleFileAttachment for each attachment, and pass them all collectively as a list
    of SimpleFileAttachment objects into the attachments parameter, as seen in
    example #3.

If you use the file_bytes parameter, you MUST provide a valid filename and
content_type parameter, and CANNOT provide a filepath parameter.
